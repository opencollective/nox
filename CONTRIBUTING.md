# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving Nox. Nox is open-source under the
[Apache License Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and welcomes contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

Nox is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/theacodes/nox).

## Support, questions, and feature requests

Feel free to file a bug on [GitHub](https://github.com/theacodes/nox).

## Reporting issues

File a bug on [GitHub](https://github.com/theacodes/nox). To help us figure out what's going on, please err on the
side of including lots of information, such as:

* Operating system.
* Python version.
* If possible, a minimal case that can reproduce the issue.

## Pull requests

* It's recommended to file a bug before starting work on anything. It'll allow
  chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
* Nox maintains 100% test coverage. All pull requests must maintain this.
* Follow [pep8](https://pep8.org).
* Update documentation, if relevant.

## Running tests

Nox runs its own tests (it's recursive!). The best thing to do is start with
a known-good nox installation, e.g. from PyPI:

    pip install --pre --upgrade nox

To just check for lint errors, run:

    nox --session lint

To run against a particular Python version:

    nox --session tests-3.5
    nox --session tests-3.6
    nox --session tests-3.7

When you send a pull request Travis will handle running everything, but it is
recommended to test as much as possible locally before pushing.

## Getting a sticker

If you've contributed to Nox, you can get a cute little Nox sticker. Reach out to Thea at me@thea.codes to request one.

## Getting paid

Contributions to Nox can be expensed through [our Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/python-nox). The maintainers will let you know when and for how much you can expense contributions, but always feel free to ask. 


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/nox).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
